In 2012, National Geographic's Traveller magazine named Kerala as one of the "ten paradises of the world"[685][686] and "50 must see destinations of a lifetime". Travel and Leisure also described Kerala as "One of the 100 great trips for the 21st century".[685][688] In 2012, it overtook the Taj Mahal to be the number one travel destination in Google's search trends for India.[689] CNN Travel listed Kerala among its '19 best places to visit in 2019'.[690] Kerala was named by TIME magazine in 2022 among the 50 extraordinary destinations to explore in its list of the World's Greatest Places.

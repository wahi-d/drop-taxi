Its history can be traced as far back as the fourth century BC when Greek ethnographer Megasthenes visited and wrote about it. The city's role in the spice trade with the Mediterranean led it to have cosmopolitan connections and a cultured lifestyle. Madurai also hosted gatherings of Tamil writers and poets during the ancient Sangam era and has remained a major center for Tamil culture and learning.</p>

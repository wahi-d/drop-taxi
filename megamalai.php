It is dotted with cardamom plantations and tea plantations. The mountain range is 1,500 metres above sea level, and it is rich in flora and fauna. The area, now mostly planted with tea plants, includes cloudlands, high wavys, venniar, and the manalar estates belonging to the Woodbriar Group. Access is largely restricted and includes largely untouched remnants of evergreen forest.</p>

A rain gauge at the border of the Kookal forest at 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) recorded rainfall about 50% higher than that of two rain gauges in grasslands at the same altitude and northern slope during 1956â€“1966 </p>

It is also known as Cloudland Falls as it originates in the Megamalai Hills. In the local language, Chinna means small or younger, so in a sense, it is called the younger Suruli Falls and is different from Suruli Falls which is situated near Cumbum town. </p>

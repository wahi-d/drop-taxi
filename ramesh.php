Lord Ram is said to have worshiped Lord Shiva, the destroyer, there to be cleared of sin for killing Ravan. Ramanathaswamy Temple is also remarkable because it has two lingams (symbols of Lord Shiva).</p>

That is what “Kushi” means in Indian languages. The water was still and wave less. We could walk easily into the water. The beach is two KMs off the highway and the road is good.
Don’t miss this when you visit Rameshwaram next time. The beach is empty on weekdays and gets local crowd only on weekends.</p>
